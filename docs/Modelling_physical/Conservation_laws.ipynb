    "How can we use math to predict the behavior of physical systems? In this chapter we cover principles for modeling physical systems; differential equations, with a focus on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs); systems of equations; vector calculus; one-, two- and three-dimensional mechanical systems (statics and dynamics); and resistive and linear electric circuits."
