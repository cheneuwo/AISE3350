    "[Pacemakers](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/pacemakers) are small devices used to treat heart [arrhythmias](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/arrhythmias). During an arrhythmia, the heart can beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Pacemakers send electrical pulses to help your heart beat at a normal rate and rhythm. Pacemakers can also be used to help your heart chambers beat in sync so your heart can pump blood more efficiently to your body. This may be needed if you have heart failure. "

The pulses help coordinate electrical signaling between the two ventricles to help your heart pump blood. This type of pacemaker is also called a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device."

    "In this approach, the device is placed inside the chamber of the heart through a small tube inserted in one of the vein, thus no surgery is needed. The battery life of a leadless pacemaker is up to 10 years or more. Its strength will be checked at follow-up visits. The battery can't be recharged. If the battery gets low, you will need to decide whether to have another procedure to replace the pacemaker."
