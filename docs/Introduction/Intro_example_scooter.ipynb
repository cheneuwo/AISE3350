    "Thus, the control board serves, in addition as a connection between the sensing and actuation domains, the computational core by implementing algorithms that respond to changing physical conditions, often within milli-seconds, and instruct the actuators to respond rider's movement or intentions: When a rider leans forward, the sensors detect this shift in weight distribution and communicate it to the control board, which in turns sends signals to electric motors that propel the wheels forward at the precisely the speed needed to keep the rider upright."

    "This closed-loop feedback system is sometimes compared to the working of the *inner ear*, the *brain*, and the *muscular* system of a human body, and exemplified the tight coupling between physical processes and the computational control that characterizes CPS. That is, the physical state directly influences computation, while computational decisions immediately affect the behaviour of the physical components."
